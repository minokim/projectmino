<h1>Tapas story</h1>
<p><strong>The Harry Potter brand, anchored by the best selling book series in history and believed to be worth well over $15 billion, all began as one person's whimsical imaginings during an afternoon train ride.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:20px;">It's stories like these that fascinate us â€” one person's story changing the world. There are many more stories waiting to be discovered, and at Tapas Media, we want to help your imagination take flight. We're here to help storytellers publish their work, build fan communities, and earn rewards from their creative labor.</p>
<p><u>If you have a story to tell, let Tapas Media help you share it with the world.</u></p>
